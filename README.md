# OctoJoin

A Go application that monitors Octopus Energy (UK) saving sessions and free electricity periods, automatically joining eligible sessions with a real-time web dashboard. Now with automatic Wheel of Fortune spinning and smart meter usage tracking!

## What it does

- **Saving Sessions**: Automatically joins sessions that earn OctoPoints for reducing energy usage
- **Free Electricity**: Monitors and alerts for periods of completely free electricity
- **Wheel of Fortune**: Automatically spins available wheels and collects OctoPoints üé∞
- **Smart Meter Graphs**: Interactive usage visualization with Chart.js integration üìä
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live web interface with countdown timers and session status
- **Smart Monitoring**: Configurable points threshold and continuous daemon mode

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run once and exit
./octojoin -account=A-1234ABCD -key=sk_live_xxx

# Continuous monitoring with web dashboard
./octojoin -daemon -web -account=A-1234ABCD -key=sk_live_xxx
```

### Using Environment Variables
```bash
export OCTOPUS_ACCOUNT_ID=A-1234ABCD

./octojoin -daemon -web
```

### Using Configuration File
```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml with your credentials
./octojoin -config=config.yaml
```

**Web Dashboard**: Access at `http://localhost:8080` (daemon mode only)

sudo useradd --system --create-home --home-dir /var/lib/octojoin --shell /bin/false octojoin
sudo mkdir -p /opt/octojoin

# 2. Install binary and config
sudo cp octojoin /opt/octojoin/
sudo cp config.example.yaml /opt/octojoin/config.yaml
sudo chown root:octojoin /opt/octojoin/config.yaml
sudo chmod 640 /opt/octojoin/config.yaml

# 3. Edit configuration
sudo nano /opt/octojoin/config.yaml

# 4. Install and start service
sudo cp octojoin.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now octojoin
```

### Service Management
```bash
sudo systemctl status octojoin          # Check status
sudo journalctl -u octojoin -f          # Follow logs
sudo systemctl restart octojoin         # Restart service
```

## Monitoring & Metrics

### Prometheus Metrics
The web server exposes metrics at `/metrics` for Grafana/Prometheus monitoring:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `octojoin_account_balance_pounds` | Account balance |
| `octojoin_octopoints_total` | OctoPoints balance |
| `octojoin_saving_sessions_total` | Joined saving sessions |
| `octojoin_wheel_spins_total{fuel_type}` | Wheel of Fortune spins |
| `octojoin_free_electricity_sessions_upcoming` | Upcoming free sessions |
| `octojoin_cache_age_seconds{cache_type}` | Cache age monitoring |

### Example Grafana Queries
```promql
octojoin_account_balance_pounds              # Account balance over time
octojoin_octopoints_total                    # OctoPoints over time  
sum(octojoin_wheel_spins_total)              # Total spins available
octojoin_cache_age_seconds < 300             # Cache freshness check
```

## Features

- **Dual Session Support**: Monitors saving sessions and free electricity periods
- **Automatic Joining**: Joins eligible saving sessions based on points threshold
- **Wheel of Fortune Auto-Spin**: Automatically spins available wheels and collects OctoPoints
- **Smart Meter Integration**: Interactive usage graphs with multiple time periods (1-30 days)
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Live web interface with countdown timers and usage visualization
- **Compatibility Testing**: Comprehensive `-test` flag to verify all features work with your account
- **Smart Caching**: Intelligent API caching based on real-world update patterns
- **Multiple Run Modes**: One-shot, continuous daemon, or systemd service
- **Robust Error Handling**: JWT token management, exponential backoff, rate limiting
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics for cache effectiveness and system health

## Building

```bash
go build -o octojoin
```

## How it Works

- **One-Shot Mode**: Run once and exit (default) - ideal for cron jobs
- **Daemon Mode**: Continuous monitoring with smart interval adjustment
- **Smart Intervals**: Dynamic timing based on UK business hours and session patterns
  - Peak hours (2-4 PM weekdays): 5-minute checks for faster session detection
  - Business hours (9 AM-6 PM weekdays): 10-minute intervals
  - Off-peak (evenings/weekends): 30-minute intervals
  - Event-driven: Increased frequency after finding new sessions
- **Smart Filtering**: Only joins sessions meeting your points threshold
- **Intelligent Caching**: Optimized API usage based on real-world update patterns
  - Smart meter devices: 7-day cache (rarely changes)
  - Usage measurements: 30-minute cache (updated regularly)
  - Wheel spins: 12-hour cache (daily refresh)
  - Account info: 1-hour cache (balance updates)
- **State Persistence**: Session tracking stored in `~/.config/octojoin/`
- **Free Electricity Alerts**: Smart alerting at key intervals to avoid spam
- **Automatic Wheel Spinning**: Detects and spins all available wheels, collecting OctoPoints automatically
- **Usage Visualization**: Interactive charts with selectable time periods (1 day to 30 days)
